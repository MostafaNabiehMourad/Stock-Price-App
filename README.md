I built the project to visualize data with Pandas, Yfinance, and streamlit to make Stock Price App and visualize price closing and volume between 2018 - 2020 for Apple Company then used yfinance (yfinance is Yahoo! Finance market data downloader Ever since Yahoo! finance decommissioned their historical data API). yfinance aimes to solve this problem by offering a reliable, threaded, and Pythonic way to download historical market data from Yahoo! finance.
